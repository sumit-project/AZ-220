In this demo, you will:
Learn how to create a device by using Azure IoT Hub in the portal

Register a new device in the IoT hub

In this section, you create a device identity in the identity registry in your IoT hub. A device cannot connect to a hub unless it has an entry in the identity registry

1.	In your IoT hub navigation menu, open IoT Devices, then select New to add a device in your IoT hub.

2.	In Create a device, provide a name for your new device, such as myDeviceId, and select Save. This action creates a device identity for     your IoT hub.

3.	After the device is created, open the device from the list in the IoT devices pane. Copy the Primary Connection String to use later.
